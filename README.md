Victron SDM72D-M-2 MID Modbus ESS driver
ode for Victron Energy Venus OS v2.93. / also tested on v3.00~22

The default meter password is 1000 if anyone else needs it.

Tested with the following equipment:

Counter: https://amzn.to/3JQkkja (currently only costs 62.50 EUR)

it should also work with the cheaper https://amzn.to/3KkEROl (without MID certification, currently 54 EUR)

RS485 USB adapter: https://amzn.to/3Jw5lL8 (the version with FT232RL chip, currently 18.50 EUR)

So why spend so much on an ET340 that has no display?

First set your meter to 19200 baud (see manual). Second place code in /opt/victronenergy/.
